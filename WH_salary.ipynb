As for the large amount of women in low paying positions, the White House's explanation does hold up; it could be interpreted as a pipeline. By recruiting more female employees, it is possible that more females will end up in senior positions solely due to large numbers. The cause behind the diminishing number of junior male staffers is a mystery, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "These conclusions come with the caveat that the delineation of male and female names was largely automated for the 2009-2014 datasets.  As ambiguous names tend to overcount the number of men (Blair, Taylor, etc..), there is the possibility of overcounting the number of men during those years. \n",
